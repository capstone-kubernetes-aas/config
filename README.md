Reasearch and resources on configuration components and config file layout came from the Kubernetes documentation page.

These config options are split into 3 files.

For the service and deployment templates, multiple may be used by the user.

Note that these service and deployment configs can be compiled into one yaml file, but I have so far separated them for ease of reading and use.
